# About Me.
## My Interest
  * My biggest interest, apart from my family, is soccer. Specifically my favorite team Real Madrid.
  * My second interest is gaming, I enjoy gaming tremendously because I can enjoy it with my wife and daughter, at the moment we enjoy playing Fortnite.

## Websites I Recommend
  * [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) - I prefer DuckDuckGo over Google because of the search algorithm shows results that google doesn't.
  * [Real Madrid](https://www.realmadrid.com) - I recommend the Real Madrid website so that you can learn about the **_best_** football club in the world.
